    Process all the form logic rules and mutate the step configuration if required.

    The form logic evaluation is split up in multiple stages to achieve a deterministic
    output while respecting the ordering of logic rules. The logic evaluation has a
    number of side effects:

    * setting/writing values for variables
    * dynamic Formio configuration updates, based on the variable values
    * dynamic Formio configuration updates, based on the logic actions

    We achieve this by:

    1. Loading the submission and submission step (passed as function arguments)
    2. Prefilled data is saved at submission start and available in the variables
    3. Loading the variable state, which populates non-saved values with their defaults
    4. Apply any dirty data (unsaved) to the variable state
    5. Evaluate conditional logic
    6. Evaluate the logic rules in order, for each action in each triggered rule:

       1. If a variable value is being updated, update the data structure (also includes
          handling the clear-on-hide behaviour)
       2. Else record the action to perform to the configuration (but don't apply it
          yet!)

    7. Apply the dynamic configuration

       1. Apply the component property mutations that were recorded in 6
       2. Interpolate the component configuration with the variables
       3. Handle custom formio types

    8. Update relevant data structures

       1. Update the variables state
       2. Create a data difference between before and after applying form logic

    :param step: Submission-step instance.
