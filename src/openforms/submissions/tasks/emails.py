    Render and send the confirmation e-mail if conditions are met.

    The following conditions must apply before an e-mail can be sent:

    1. There may not have been an e-mail sent out yet
    2. There must be a template configured

    Note that this task is NOT a celery-once task - only the function arguments are
    taken into account for the lock-key and not the countdown/eta. This would break
    the mechanism where the task is scheduled with the timeout of 15 minutes from
    :func:`maybe_send_confirmation_email` already, followed by the payment views
    calling this task for immediate execution. The immediate execution would then not
    be scheduled and we would always get the timeout e-mail.

    We protect against race-conditions by locking the submission database row, if a
    lock can not be acquired, this means that another transaction already holds the lock
    and is sending an e-mail, so we abort our own attempt.

    This also protects against race conditions in the case that payment and cosign are completed at the same time.
