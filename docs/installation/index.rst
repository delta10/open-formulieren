Installation
============

You can install Open Forms in several ways, depending on your intended purpose
and expertise.

1. Using `Helm charts <https://github.com/maykinmedia/charts>`_ in Kubernetes environments.
2. Run with :ref:`Docker Compose <installation_docker_compose>` on your computer for private testing purposes
3. Run from :ref:`Python code <developers_installation>` on your computer for development purposes

.. note::

   If you don't want to install Open Forms yourself, you can ask an Open Forms
   supplier to host and manage it for you.

After installation, follow the :ref:`configuration_index` instructions to enable all available features.
